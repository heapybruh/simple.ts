## Tested with NodeLink
*YouTube started blocking Discord bots completely, whether they're using NodeLink or LavaLink. 🥲*  
*Unfortunately simple.ts has been offline for months because of that.*
- Version: [`2.2.0 commit 86f3189`](https://github.com/PerformanC/NodeLink/commit/86f3189627dd63a66bae382d5453ae6c5f7730a1)
